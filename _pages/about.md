# üò∫ About Me

I am currently a second-year master‚Äôs student in the School of Psychology at Jiangxi Normal University, having commenced my studies in September 2022 and anticipating graduation in June 2025. Prior to my master‚Äôs program, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology at the same institution, from September 2018 to June 2022. 

My academic journey has been profoundly shaped by Dr. [Fulei Geng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fulei-Geng), who has been my steadfast research supervisor since September 2019, when I first joined his laboratory, and continues to guide me to this day. His mentorship has been pivotal throughout my academic journey, including the guidance he provided for both my undergraduate thesis and my current master‚Äôs dissertation.

My current **research** mainly focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders, particularly: 1) the psychosocial and pathological mechanisms of PTSD and its subtypes; 2) protective and risk factors for psychological distress, especially childhood experiences, and intergenerational transmission.

{% comment %}
I am currently seeking a doctoral position in the field of clinical science and/or development psychology, with interests in: 
- The underlying mechanisms of affective and neurodevelopmental psychopathology (e.g., trauma and stressor-related disorders, anxiety, irritability) using a combination of physiological, behavioral, and neuroimaging tools.
- The dynamic and longitudinal relationship between environmental factors (e.g., adversity, childhood experiences, family parenting) and neural, psychosocial, and cognitive development in children, adolescents, and adults.
- Protective and risk factors for affective and neurodevelopmental psychopathology.
- Effective interventions to mitigate the negative impacts of trauma and adversity.
{% endcomment %}

In my **future doctoral research**, I want to acquire multifaceted skills in physiology, behavior, and imaging to explore the etiology and pathology of stress-related disorders comprehensively in adolescents and adults.
