<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year master's student in the School of Psychology at Jiangxi Normal University. My research supervisor is [Dr. Fulei Geng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fulei-Geng).

My current research focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders, particularly: 1) the psychosocial and pathological mechanisms of PTSD and its subtypes; 2) protective and risk factors for psychological distress, especially childhood experiences and intergenerational transmission.

In my future doctoral research, I plan to acquire skills in physiology, behavior, and imaging. Using techniques from laboratory experiments to neuroimaging, I hope to explore the etiology and pathology of trauma- and stressor-related disorders comprehensively.

I plan to apply for a doctorate program this year, focusing on clinical, developmental, or cognitive neuroscience psychology.

# ‚≠ê Research Interests
-   Investigating the etiopathological mechanisms and developmental trajectories of trauma- and stress-related disorders and anxiety, utilizing behavioral, physiological, and neuroimaging techniques.
-   Examining the intersection of physiological factors (genetics and cortisol), sociopsychological aspects (social relationships, stress and trauma events, childhood experiences), behavioral paradigms, and imaging techniques (fMRI) to understand the pathogenesis of these disorders.
-   Conducting research across diverse groups, including the general population, disadvantaged populations, and patients with disorders, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the etiology and progression of trauma- and stress-related, anxiety-related disorders.
